DO NOT INSTALL THIS FILE TO THE CALCULATOR.

All programs should be saved to the archive! If saved to the RAM, they will be erased if you decide to clear the RAM and the calculator will quickly run out of RAM, forcing you to clear it, and ultimately deleting the things you installed on the RAM.

Install arTIfiCE.8xv so you can run all of these

If you are installing OIRAM.8xp, dont forget to install the OiramPK, OiramS, and OiramT.8xv files or else it will say something like "appVars missing."

If you are installing CE2048.8xp or CE2048Dark.8xp, make sure you install clips.8xg or these will not run. Also if you decide to install both, make sure to rename one so it will word because they will both show up with the name "CE2048" on the calculator despite having different file names.

cesium.8xp is basically a file viewer. You can install it so you dont have to open Cabri Jr. every time you want to play any of these games.
