All programs should be saved to the archive! If saved to the RAM, they will be erased if you decide to clear the RAM and the calculator will quickly run out of RAM, forcing you to clear it, and ultimately deleting the things you installed on the RAM.

# Installing the Jailbreak
Install `arTIfiCE.8xv` so you can run all of these. Once installed, open Cabri Jr. to arTIfiCE SHELL and you can run these programs

# File Requirements
## OIRAM (Mario Knock-off) AppVars
If you are installing `OIRAM.8xp`, dont forget to install the `OiramPK`, `OiramS`, and `OiramT.8xv` files or else it will say something like "appVars missing."

## CE2048 (2048 Remake)
If you are installing `CE2048.8xp` (classic theme) or `CE2048Dark.8xp` (dark theme), make sure you install `clips.8xg` or these will not run. Also if you decide to install both, make sure to rename one so it will word because they will both show up with the name "CE2048" on the calculator despite having different file names.

# Optional Files/Apps
## [Cesium](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1372/x2292)
`cesium.8xp` is basically a file viewer. You can install it so you dont have to open Cabri Jr. every time you want to play any of these games.
### Installation
*See the [website](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/files/1372/x2292) for instructions*

## Python
The only way I know to install it is by installing `TI84CEPythonBundle-5.7.0.17.b84`, which Python comes with it.

# NOTICE
Because I don't have my personal TI-84 Plus CE Python near me, I can't guarantee the process of installing the jailbreak and others. If you are having trouble installing something with the steps I gave you, [file an issue here](https://github.com/ashbit06/CE-Games/issues/new/choose) and I will try to correct my mistakes.
